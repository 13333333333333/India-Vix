### Clothing image classification  
In this notebook, I go through the steps taken to use ANN, CNN and make clothing predictions. Alongside those, we use traditional analysis methods much as gradient boosting and random forest. We also note that there is a time complexity trade-off between the deep learning methods and the traditional learning ones.
