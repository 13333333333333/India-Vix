### K Means Clustering (**KMC**) and Principal Component analysis (**PCA**) project  
Methodology:
- used scaler to normalize the feature values
- used KMC together with Cross Validation to yield best clustering
- fitted the clusters and showed data for 2 and 3 components
- employed PCA afterwards
- proved that PCA can be effectively used together with KMC (in this context)

### Areas of improvement:
- Doing a cross-comparison analysis with a supervised algorithm (i.e. using Random Forest/ensemble training methods to fit the data, then validating the data results with the training data)
- Paying more attention to feature selection (i.e. using F-test/Boruta algo to determine important or non-important features)
- Getting rid of outliers
- Creating a terse pipeline for this data project (to enable easy deployment)
